# Quote_generator
Small project to learn simple algorytm in Javascript that's responsible in generating random quote from dictionary each time when user click on the button. 
Quote generator might be solved in many diffrent ways, next time I would like to try to use API to get quotes or to use JSON for getting quotes.
This project also helped me understand how to add actual time and date into my pages.
